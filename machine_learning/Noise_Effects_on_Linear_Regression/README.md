# Linear Regression with Noise Analysis

This project demonstrates the application of linear regression models to data with two types of noise: **normal noise** and **uniform noise**. It includes visualizations of the data, fitted regression lines, and a comparison of the model's performance with different types of noise.

## Overview

Linear regression is used to model the relationship between an independent variable \( x \) and a dependent variable \( y \). In this project, we generate synthetic data with normal and uniform noise and apply linear regression to fit a model to the noisy data.

Key features of this project:
- **Normal Noise**: Random noise sampled from a normal distribution.
- **Uniform Noise**: Random noise sampled from a uniform distribution.
- **Linear Regression Model**: Applied to data with both types of noise.
- **Visualization**: Scatter plots and fitted lines for data with normal and uniform noise.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `sklearn`

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-learn
